    "# Quantum Key Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "In quantum key distribution (QKD), the use of randomness extractors is required to perform an essential subroutine known as privacy amplification.\n",
    "\n",
    "A general QKD protocol has the following setup. \n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Raw Key Exchange:** Raw key is exchanged between two parties. This is the only part of QKD that requires quantum resources.\n",
    "  * **Key Sifting:** Certain rounds are selected which will be processed into shared secret key. \n",
    "  * **Parameter Estimation:** Statistical parameters about the key exchange are estimated.\n",
    "  * **Error Correction:** Both parties raw keys are manipulated into a jointly shared raw key, which may be partially known by an adversary.\n",
    "  * **Privacy Amplification:** The jointly shared raw key is processed into a shorter, uniform and private shared secret key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, some of these steps assume the two parties have initial uniform (and sometimes private) shared randomness. \n"
