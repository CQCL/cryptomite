“Object” form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, and conversions to other media types.

“Source” form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications, including but not limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration files.

“Work” shall mean the work made available under the License, namely the compilation of extractor software and algorithms for generating and verifying highly entropic data.

“You” (or “Your”) shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising permissions granted by this License.

2. Grant of Copyright License.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the Licensor hereby grants to You a worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, revocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form, for Academic Research Purposes only, wherein Commercial Use of the Work is strictly prohibited.
