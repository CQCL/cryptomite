Examples
========

In this section we give some explicit examples and pseudocode using \texttt{cryptomite} on recent experimental quantum cryptography demonstrations.
Since our package is easy to use, efficient and numerically precise, it is perfect for these applications. 
We also highlight some extensions in these examples, whereby the results of these previous works could be improved by some combination of 
(i) relaxing assumptions and (ii) speeding-up implementation.
