    "# Quantum Key Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "In quantum key distribution (QKD), the use of randomness extractors is required to perform an essential subroutine known as privacy amplification.\n",
    "\n",
    "A general QKD protocol has the following setup. \n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Raw Key Exchange:** Raw key is exchanged between two parties. This is the only part of QKD that requires quantum resources.\n",
    "  * **Key Sifting:** Certain rounds are selected which will be processed into shared secret key. \n",
    "  * **Parameter Estimation:** Statistical parameters about the key exchange are estimated.\n",
    "  * **Error Correction:** Both parties raw keys are manipulated into a jointly shared raw key, which may be partially known by an adversary.\n",
    "  * **Privacy Amplification:** The jointly shared raw key is processed into a shorter, uniform and private shared secret key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, some of these steps assume the two parties have initial uniform (and sometimes private) shared randomness. \n"

    "## Experimental CV-QKD\n",
    "Following the experimental results of the continuous variable protocol outlined in \\cite{jain2022practical}, we give pseudocode replicating the\n",
    "privacy amplification step of their experiment using our extractor library \\texttt{extlib}. This example can be easily adapted to any explicit QKD protocol. \n",
    "In this protocol, the quantum information is encoded into the amplitude and phase quadratures of the optical field. \n",
    "Alice encodes random bits, which she generates with a quantum random number generator (QRNG), by modulating the optical signal field to obtain coherent states.\n",
    "The QRNG used to generate random bits is based on \\cite{gabriel2010generator}, which consists of homodyne measurements of the vacuum state. \n",
    "Bob decodes this information using coherent detection, facilitated by a so-called local oscillator.\n",
    "For security against a quantum adversary, a quantum proof randomness extractor must be used for privacy amplification.\n",
    "\n",
    "All security parameters are set to $10^{-10}$, except for correctness error after sifting, which is $10^{-12}$.\n",
    "The protocol starts with $\\mathrm{N}=10^9$ key generation rounds, which becomes $\\mathrm{N_{sifted}}= 9.88 \\times 10^8$ after sifting. \n",
    "After parameter estimation and error correction using multi edge type low-density parity check error correcting codes, they are left with\n",
    "$\\mathrm{N_{EC}} = 8.69 \\times 10^8$. Since measurements are performed in 2 quadratures, \n",
    "this gives $n = 1.738 \\times 10^9$ raw key bits for privacy amplification\n",
    "on both Alice and Bob's side, which should be identical (up to the errors of prior protocol steps).\n",
    "Based on the security parameters, a final secret key length of $41378264$ is calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The experimental implementation uses the $\\Toeplitz$ extractor for privacy amplification, with a raw key input length \n",
    "of $n = 1.738 \\times 10^9$, an output of $m = 41378264$ and therefore, a required seed length of $d = 1.738 \\times 10^9 + 41378263$.\n",
    "This privacy amplification step can be performed easily using our randomness extractor library \\texttt{extlib} as follows in Fig. \\ref{fig:pa}. \n"
