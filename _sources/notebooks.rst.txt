Examples
========

Here we give examples using ``Cryptomite`` for the randomness extraction step in recent experimental quantum cryptography demonstrations, specifically, the tasks of 
quantum key distribution and quantum random number generation.
We also highlight some extensions in these examples, whereby the results of these previous works could be improved by some combination of 
(i) relaxing assumptions and (ii) speeding-up implementation.
